- Docker comes with hyperv and has an instance of Linux container running inside hyperv
- On windows, minikube cannot have both hyperv and virtualbox. Since Docker already comes with hyperv instance, we used hyperv instead.
- Run gitbash as administrator.
- Drop both minikube.exe and kubectl.exe into c:/users/vrahimi
- Need a virtual switch: Hyper-V Manager > Action > Virtual Swith Manager .. Primary Virtual Switch
- minikube start --memory 10240 --cpus=4 --disk-size=30g --vm-driver=hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch "Primary Virtual Switch"
- kubectl get pods
- minikube dashboard --url

- To reinstall - delete the .minikube and .kube folders from %USERPROFILE% folder. Additionally, open Hyper-V Manager and delete the minkube VM. 
- minikube status
- minikube stop/start
- minikube ssh
